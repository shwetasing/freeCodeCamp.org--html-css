		<p>“If I packed only two sets of informal clothes, he would rotate them through an entire tour if he had to and not think about it. He doesn’t care for gadgets, and barely registers brands – of watches, cologne or cars. But if the weight of his bat was off by a gram, he would notice it in an instant and get the problem fixed”- <strong style = "color: black">Vijeeta Dravid</strong></p>
		<p>“Try to take his wicket in the first 15 minutes, if you can’t then only try to take the remaining wickets.”- <strong style = "color: black">Steve Waugh</strong></p>
		<p>“Rahul Dravid being known as ‘The Wall’ is pretty much spot on. ‘The fortress’ could also describe Rahul. Because once, Dravid was set, you needed the bowling equivalent of a dozen cannon firing all at once to blast him down.”- <strong style = "color: black">Shane Warne</strong></p>
